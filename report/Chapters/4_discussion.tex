\section{Challenges and limitations}

%Difficult decisions had to be made in planning the research, leading to subsequent tradeoffs. Then, focus in on the need for future work.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Low contrast}

There is a very low contrast between the background and the roots, so that one could hardly recognise the roots on some images [INSERT EXAMPLE IMAGE HERE].
Inverting the image was not enough. We intensified the contrast by ... / making the background darker, we increased the brightness. We used further filtering so that the difference between two pixels is more pronounced.
It was very much a trial \& error process.

Classify only things without structure as noise. 
Noise was subtle/ hiding and could only be seen on filtered images.

Many objects of no interest which can be not 


[INSERT 4 EXAMPLES HOW DIFFICULT DATA WAS]


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Objects interferring with objet of interest}

Eg specs not so much of an issue as separate from the root.
Issue when it is connected.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Skeletonisation}
Get rid of loop.

How to go along the curve?


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scalability}

A lot of paramter tuning to single images. Work with single images to tune.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reproducability}

angle computation yes, but still variability in pre-processing step


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Highly pixeled images}
Due to compressing? 
Challenge in curvature computing part
Eg using Hough transform from Matlab Image Processing Toolbox to detect lines in an image not applicable here as highly pixled image.

% GIVE SAMPLE IMAGE

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Problems}
A lot of trial \& error / hand-picking. 


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{High user-interaction}
Might be reduced with better-quality images, however very flexible.


standard-deviation not as high as i think?

Would be desirable if it could be automated more. 

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Suggestions for future data acquisition}


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{More focus on images}


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Resolution}

Better camera, less waste of resolution

improve spatial resolution, other format? no compression?
 
 
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Broader application of this tool}

This tool can be reused for many purposes, it is not restricted to root detection.
Might also be used for easier problems like gravitropism.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Further work}

Here in the first version of the tool, the main goal was to standardise the angle computation; if in the future  a method for handling the different noise pattern in the images was efficiently handled which require less user input, it would be desireable to automate the whole angle computation.

Use on better-quality images in the future.

%High-throughput software tools that can produce objective, quantitative analyses od the resulting images are now required.

graph on GUI will be implemented, to make sure that we are computing the right angle.


- How tool accessible for people who do not have matlab?

NowL GUI reenter, no single script. no time, just did not bother, can easily be added.



\subsection{Other programming languages}

Alternative languages that were considered were \textit{Python} and \textit{Julia}. Another recommended language is \textit{OpenCV} as it is very fast and well documented. Other non-open source software such as \textit{ImageJ}, a Java based image processing program, and \textit{Avizo} which is a general-purpose commercial software application for scientific and industrial data visualisation and analysis with a nice GUI, could not be investigated further in this work. 


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Other ways of curvature and angle measuring}

What was implemented as we found that this approach worked best on these data and this resolution.

%Standardised and automated version of angle computation
\subsection{Othere definition of the angle}
Approaches like computing the Gaussian mean curvature, definitions of different, possibly more robust methods of computing and angle %are mentioned here, but has 
have not been incorporated in our final tool.
