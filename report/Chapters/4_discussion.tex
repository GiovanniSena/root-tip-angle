\section{Challenges}

\subsection{Low contrast}

There is a very low contrast between the background and the roots, so that one could hardly recognise the roots on some images [INSERT EXAMPLE IMAGE HERE].
Inverting the image was not enough. We intensified the contrast by ... / making the background darker, we increased the brightness. We used further filtering so that the difference between two pixels is more pronounced.
It was very much a trial \& error process.

Classify only things without structure as noise. 
Noise was subtle/ hiding and could only be seen on filtered images.

Many objects of no interest which can be not 


[INSERT 4 EXAMPLES HOW DIFFICULT DATA WAS]

\subsection{Objects interferring with objet of interest}

Eg specs not so much of an issue as separate from the root.
Issue when it is connected.

\subsection{Skeletonisation}
Get rid of loop.

How to go along the curve?

\subsection{Scalability}

A lot of paramter tuning to single images. Work with single images to tune.


\subsection{Reproducability}

angle computation yes, but still variability in pre-processing step

\subsection{Problems}
A lot of trial \& error / hand-picking. 

\subsection{High user-interaction}
Might be reduced with better-quality images, however very flexible.

\section{Suggestions for future data acquisition}


\subsection{More focus on images}

\subsection{Resolution}

Better camera, less waste of resolution

\section{Broader application of this tool}

This tool can be reused for many purposes, it is not restricted to root detection.
Might also be used for easier problems like gravitropism.

\section{Further work}

Here in the first version of the tool, the main goal was to standardise the angle computation; if in the future  a method for handling the different noise pattern in the images was efficiently handled which require less user input, it would be desireable to automate the whole angle computation.

Use on better-quality images in the future.

%High-throughput software tools that can produce objective, quantitative analyses od the resulting images are now required.
