% OVERVIEW / STAND-ALONE SUMMARY OF THE WORK 
% < 300 words
% summary that identifies the purpose, problem, methods, results, and conclusion of your work
% In the following work we we developed a root tip plant\\
%  1) the overall purpose of the study and the research problem(s) you investigated; \\
%  2) the basic design of the study; \\
%  3) major findings or trends found as a result of your analysis; and, \\
%  4) a brief summary of your interpretations and conclusions.

Plant morphology studies the form and structure of plants and how these develop over time under different circumstances. \\
%It compares and interprets these structures in various plants of the same or different species which can lead to insights into the underlying biology, and the understanding of plant relationships and plant evolution.\\
One phenomenon that, despite being first identified more than 100 years ago, has not been researched much and we know little about its underlying molecular mechanisms, is electrotropism.
Electrotropism describes the response of a plant to an electric field; one common response is the curving of a plant’s root tip. Unlike gravitropism [DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT HERE?] there exist to our knowledge no tools specifically designed to assist biologists in studying this effect, most importantly the angle resulting from the curving of root tips. This is especially relevant as the experiment setup is more complex and the images tend to be more error-prone, which is often the reason why standard gravitropism study tools fail and biologists compute angle resulting from the curved root tip manually.

Here we present \textit{RootSkel}, a novel intuitive and robust stand-alone software for image processing developed in \textit{MATLAB}, whose pipeline was optimised for noise-intensive electrotropism images. % built from the ground up. 
Unlike when doing the angle computation to measure the curvature of a root tip manually, our tool ensures a standardised version of the angle computation. To make the tool more user-friendly, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that will help the user in processing the images and computing the angles in a standardised and controlled fashion.

%Our data set consisted of high-throughput time-lapse images of Arabidopsis roots taken by a standard Raspberry Pi V2 camera from 5 experiments with 5-6 roots each containing between 32 and 36 images over a period of approximately 5 hours. 

% produced by the Plant Morphology lab at Imperial College London. 
%We will present an example for the user on how to use the tool.

%Additionally, we evaluated our results by comparing it to previously manually computed angles. [INCLUDE RESULTS A LA 70\% of the images could be found to be reproduced]

Additionally we computed the angle of three Arabidopsis root tips at 30 time points over one whole experiment (approximately 5 hours) and evaluated the results by comparing it to previously manually computed angles on the same images. The results show same patterns as manual computed angles;
% overall correspondence with manual angles; 
statistics on our data set suggest that our tool removes human error in the angle calculation process %which accounts in average [INSERT VARIANCE HERE, STATE HOW MUCH HUMAN VARIANCE WE COULD ELIMINATE BY STANDARDISING IT] 
of up to 10\% of the actual angle. However, further validation on more images need to be done. Unlike the manually computed angles, with using a standard definition of the angle, our software delivers angles free from human bias which makes the results comparable and reproducible. 
% Indeed, we show that on this example we can eliminate in average [INSERT VARIANCE HERE, STATE HOW MUCH HUMAN VARIANCE WE COULD ELIMINATE BY STANDARDISING IT] of human bias; further validation on more images is to be done.
%can be done on already existing data as well as data gathered in the future. 
Previously computed angles can be checked by using our software, and more angles of curved roots can be computed in the future and hopefully %help 
reveal interesting insights in electrotropism. 
Moreover, our tool is not limited to roots but could theoretically be used on any curved object; slight modifications in the code and the GUI might be necessary.
