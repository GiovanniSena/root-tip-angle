# root-tip-angle

In this project, we will develop a stand-alone software for image processing and quantitative measurements of plant roots. 
The tool will be used on 2D high-throughput time-lapse images of Arabidopsis roots exposed to an external electric field.

Goal: robust and intuitive pipeline to 
* standardise the root tip angle computation so far done manually
* automate the image processing protocol, going from raw images to a measurement of root tip alignment with respect to the field direction. 

Future: 
* user-friendly GUI
* (statistical) analysis of the collected data and quantification of population heterogeneity in electrotropic response
