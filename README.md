# RootSkel -- A software tool to compute a plant's curved root tip

In this project, I developed a robust and intuitive pipeline for image processing and quantitative measurements of plant root tips to
* standardise the root tip angle computation so far done manually
* automate the image processing protocol, going from raw images to a measurement of root tip alignment with respect to the field direction. 

The tool comes with a user-friendly GUI and uses 2D high-throughput time-lapse images of Arabidopsis roots exposed to an external electric field.

Future:
* (statistical) analysis of the collected data and quantification of population heterogeneity in electrotropic response
