% UPDATE 1.9.18 00:59 - Now that we receive the poins from the user, we can
% do an initial color filtering based on the RGB values of those
% points. Let's say the minimal value of the range is x1 and the maximal value of it
% is x2. First, we will take all x>x2 and apply: f(x) = (x-x2)*(x1/(1-x2)).
% Then, we will take the values in x1<x<x2, and apply: f(x) = [(1-x0)/(x2-x1)]*x + [(x2*x0-x1)/(x2-x1)]
% Where x0 I need to determine. The second one is 'Enhancement'
