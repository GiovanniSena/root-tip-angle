*************************************************

I have decided to create the beta version.
Now that I started creating the GUI, I have decided to split the process into functions and
use several buttons in the GUI.
I will now start to implement.
For the progress so far see Old_Versions_Log.
I will start by migrating a copy of GUItest and changing it to a beta.

I then went on to separarte the image choosing and image zooming into functions 
and make the appropriate changes to the GUI code.

-21:53
I realized the flag for the zoom is no longer necessary, at least not in the 
same manner, since I shall soon add a zoom button.

-22:02
Migrated the point choosing functionality to an external function and will
now update to the one from lychtst3.

-22:19
I have started migrating the rest of the script.
Started by migrating all of it to a function called root_skel.
Now will delegate all the stuff before the imfreehand to image_process,
the crop to an image_freecrop and the skeleton will stay where it is.
Will create necessary buttons and callbacks.

-23:04
I thought I needed to change something I didn't need to. 
Now I will move the image(cropped_roots_img) to the end of point_choose.

-23:38
Small change - change the prompt of the cleaning.
Big change that will be implemented - migration of cleaning

-- 11.8.18

-01:32
Discovered impoly, which might be easier to handle than imfreehand.
But! I realized that I don't have to choose between them, I can let the user do so.

-01:39
Will try to implement the forcing of the tip now.
Just had an idea - maybe instead of the user clumsily creating a line, we will ask him to 
use impoly to encircle the area between the end of the skeleton and the tip
and whiten it.

-18:17
Several minutes ago started working on implementing a save figure button.
Had to search online for a solution for saving a specific axes.
Will use check boxes to allow the user to save either or both of the axes.

-- 12.8.18

-18:45
Decided to change a little the force tip function.
Instead of 1 we'll try to use root_points_color.
