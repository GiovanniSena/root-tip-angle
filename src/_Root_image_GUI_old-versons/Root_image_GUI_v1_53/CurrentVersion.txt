The current version is (22.8.18 19:05)
v1.53

Changes from v1.5:
* Decided to add clearing of variables to image_choose so you won't have to 
close the GUI.
* Implemented drawing lines to show the angle.

Bug fixes:
* Now you can get the curvature based angle even if you didn't choose a max_curv_point.

Changes from v1.4:
Write changes from 22.8.18 - NOT DONE YET - 24.8 14:59
* Making the default save name of the .mat file as image + root number.
I did a similar thing for the figures.
* The angle in a file with a header consisiting of image and root number.
* Updated the var_loader to clear the variables
* Added an option to crop the skeleton directly instead of cropping the image
and getting a new skeleton

Bug fixes:
* Getting the angle buttons enabled when loading variables.

Changes from v1.3:
Applying 'addpath' to include the functions folder.
Creating a pop up message when image process is through
implement a button for that getAngle.m and a (defunct for now) button for curvature.
Created loading buttons for variables and a loading for figures.


Bug fixes:
skel_clean DIDN'T ASSIGN THE RESULT TO BASE WORK SPACE BEFORE. FIXed.
In the clear image command: Both buttons told the program to clear the left axes. fixed
