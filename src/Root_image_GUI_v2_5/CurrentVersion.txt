The current version is (4.9.18 03:49)
v2.5

Changes from v 2.2:
* Implemented putting a slider beneath 'Foreign object removal' instead
of the user clicking yes repeatedly.
* Implemented the choice to save the angle or not. 
* Now the entire process when clicking one of the angle getting buttons is 
handled by a new function named angle_handler.
* Implemented a toggle button under choose points which controls whether to 
choose tip specifically

Changes from v 2.0:
* Tweaked and changed the image_process, and added small things.
* Added a slider set it so it will be between 0.5 and 3 and start at 1.75.
Now I'll tweak the colour ranges so that c_i = proc_str*(min(1,0.4+colormeans(i))),
where proc_str = 3 - process_str.Value

Future plans:
* Implementing giving the user the choice whether or not to save 
the angle they got.

Changes from v 1.5.4:
* A complete revamp of the image_process function that uses a more flexible filtering
technique and is more efficient and scaleable.
* Will now show the filtered grayscales after Process image
* Small tweaks to root_skel to accomodate the new image_process
* Both of the old image_process and root_skel still exist with an ending of '_old'.


Changes from v1.5.3:
* Change the starting point of the drawn line from the user's choice of tip
to the end of the skeleton.


Changes from v1.5:
* Decided to add clearing of variables to image_choose so you won't have to 
close the GUI.
* Implemented drawing lines to show the angle.

Bug fixes:
* Now you can get the curvature based angle even if you didn't choose a max_curv_point.

Changes from v1.4:
Write changes from 22.8.18 - NOT DONE YET - 24.8 14:59
* Making the default save name of the .mat file as image + root number.
I did a similar thing for the figures.
* The angle in a file with a header consisting of image and root number.
* Updated the var_loader to clear the variables
* Added an option to crop the skeleton directly instead of cropping the image
and getting a new skeleton

Bug fixes:
* Getting the angle buttons enabled when loading variables.

Changes from v1.3:
Applying 'addpath' to include the functions folder.
Creating a pop up message when image process is through
implement a button for that getAngle.m and a (defunct for now) button for curvature.
Created loading buttons for variables and a loading for figures.


Bug fixes:
skel_clean DIDN'T ASSIGN THE RESULT TO BASE WORK SPACE BEFORE. FIXed.
In the clear image command: Both buttons told the program to clear the left axes. fixed
