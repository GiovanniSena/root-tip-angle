%% % LOG - Started updating at 17.7.18 10:53

% Had a problem that the colour filter kind of destroyed the root. So I
% opened a live script and started tweaking. Turns out the grayness
% checker was too restrictive. So I'm trying out an approach based on the
% original colour ranges' size.

% 11:10
% Decided to adjust the previous idea by applying a multiplication to
% adjust to the multiplication of the data itself. Noticed another
% problem: now the root is cut. Will first try to reduce spur.
% It was fixed at the cost of a thorn.
% Will now apply to original code.

% 11:26
% Decided to check to loop I previously used in the brightness filter.
% The original one is too much. Will try tweaking.
% Found that if I tweak the mult. factor to 1.1 And add a scaled filter
% for a bottom constraint I get better results. Will try some more
% tweaking. Changed the number of runs to 7.
% Will now apply to original code.

% 12:26
% We will now try inverting the image at the beginning as per
% request.
% Also, will now try median filtering before the user chooses points, both for
% his sake and the script's.
% The median filtering was a complete failure. Will try to somehow
% deconvolve/deblur. The good functions require something called PSF but
% there is a blind function that uses a guess for PSF and returns a better
% estimate. So it is possible to then immediately use a better function.
% I shall test in the live script.



% %18.7.18% %

%10:41
% Had an idea: checking the surroundings of the points and if they are
% bright then choose a smaller crop window. Will try to implement now.

% 13:16
% There are some updates written all over, but that's not why I'm here.
% It would seem the filters are being too restrictive on one of the
% roots. first of all, removed 2 excess medfilts and decided to add a
% condition that if the colour ranges are too small so we'll enlarge them.

% 13:36
% Still didn't do the condition but I did tweak the colour difference,
% which didn't work well, which made me decide to do the
% *1.1*1.1*(1.1+_^2) even earlier and activate it on the colour filters as
% well. and ergo the brightness filter will also be affected.

% 18:13
% Had a genius idea on how to remove thorns EFFECTIVELY
% Doing skel-bwmorph(branchpoints) and then bwareaopen and then fill in
% the gaps. Will try

% 18:28
% maybe removing the end points before performing the cleaning will hell.

% 19.7.18

% 1:23
% Will try to use 'adaptthresh' function on the lychcrop2 at the beginning

% 1:47
% After finding that you can change the neighbourhood size achieved good
% results. Will try to implement at the beginning.

% 12:39
% Accidentally came across gamma adjustment, and it might just solve all of
% our problems. will try to implement at the beginning.

% 12:59
% Tweaked some more - sensitivity in imbinarize to 0.95 and spur to 15
% Then tweaked to 1.

% 13:05
% Tweaked so all 3 final bwareaopen (skeletor 1+2 and uniskel) will have
% the number 400. Seems to drastically improve.
% Also removed spur from unskel.
% Tweaked back for skeletor2 to 100.
% And was forced to tweak in uniskel to 70.

% 13:23
% In 4th image, multiplying by 3 from the beginning was problematic. I'll
% try moving it to after the gamma and check.
% Now I'll try to move to after the local thresh.
% Forced to cancel. Let's go over the other images and hope for the best.
% Changed the multiplication in front of the gamma correction to 18 as a
% result. But now I think that I should change it to 10 and then multiply
% the local thresh by 2. will try.

% 13:33
% Decided instead that I will try to implement a condition that if the
% image is too dark multiply by 3.
% After looking at the mean of the 4 pictures, decided on:
% if(mean(mean(mean(lych_tst2)))<0.4)

%14:33
% Changed the statistic of the adpaative thresholding to median.
% I think it improved it.

%15:17
% I have decided to try and have the user choose the file.
% I have successfully found a function for that
% uigetfile
% Will implement.

% 15:24
% Needed to change to include path. Also added the '*.jpg'.

% 15:33
% UPDATE - Replaced the content of imread to accomodate the user
% choosing the file.

% 17:40
% Time to implement the feedback of taking an average of the colours of the
% neighbourhoods for the points.

% 18:52
% After dawdling, I will move the implementation to main code.

% 19:01
% will try to implement a question for the user whether to clean the photo
% further. Then will try to implement cleaning

% 19:36
% Decided to add a new variable if the user wants cleaning so that he could
% revert one step back if he chooses to. Will also present the choice to
% revert of course.

% 23:26
% I have now found a way to do a "freehand" crop of sorts.
% Will add an optional section that allows the user to freehand crop.

% 20.7.18

% 11:42
% wanted to try to implement a cropping out of offshoots, using the imfreehand
% like yesterday night. But just before I started I had a better idea.
% I will use the freehand crop the user chose for graywarden for BOTH
% graywarden AND brighttst.



% 10.8.18, 09:35

% Started lychtst3.

% 09:50 
% I'm exploring things. For example, uisave for saving the workspace

% 13:04
% Time to implement the 3 step program:
% 1: The user chooses only the tip, which HAS to be included in the final
% skeleton.
% 2: The user chooses 5 points close to the tip which will get heavier
% weight.
% 3: The user chooses points on the rest of the root.

% 13:29
% Decided to add checks to point choice. Will create a while loop that will
% alert the user if he chooses too much or too little. And then decided to
% export to function.

% 14:47 
% Had a long break. Let's continue:
% Now we now - rootx(1) is the tip, 2-6 are the close to the tip and the
% rest are.. the rest.

% 15:46
% Decided to ask for the tip AFTER the cropping.
% Now we can force the tip to be white just before binarization.

% 16:08
% Will try to extend the white to neighbours.
