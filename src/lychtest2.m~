% Second, we will use the point to decide on the filtering range for the
% color filter, expanding it to filter using the information from the
% points before filtering according to the assumption that the rots are
% gray.
% We will now define three color filters: cfiltR, cfiltG and cfiltB, as
% 1X2 vectors. Anything outside of this range shall be filtered out. First,
% let's grab the data.

% rooty=round(rooty); % WE MOVED UPWARDS
% Next, we exract the linear indices so we can extract the
% colors.
% HAD SOME DIFFICULTY. SEARCHED FOR ANSWER. FOUND ONE:
% If you specify more than two subscripts, MATLAB extends its indexing scheme
% accordingly. For example, consider four subscripts (i,j,k,l) into a
% four-dimensional array with size [d1 d2 d3 d4]. MATLAB calculates the
% offset into the storage column by
% (l-1)(d3)(d2)(d1)+(k-1)(d2)(d1)+(j-1)(d1)+i
lychsize = size(lych_tst2);
lychpoi = [0:2]*lychsize(1)*lychsize(2)+(rootx-1)*lychsize(1)+rooty;

% Finally we extract the colors themselves of the 5 chosen pixels
% lychpcolor = lych_tst2(lychpoi);


% 19.7.18 18:54
% Mean extraction with a loop that will take the 3
% pixels in each column (3 columns)
means = 0;
for i = -1:1
    means = means + lych_tst2(lychpoi-lychsize(1)+i) + lych_tst2(lychpoi+i) + lych_tst2(lychpoi + lychsize(1) + i);
end
% Finally we extract the colors themselves of the 5 chosen pixels
lychpcolor = means./9;


% -- from here on original image no longer necessary

% % and the brighter you are the brighter you get
% lychpcolor = lychpcolor.*1.1;
% lychpcolor = lychpcolor.*1.1;
% lychpcolor = lychpcolor.*(1.1+lychpcolor.^2);
% Gamma correction conflixts with this and is better

% And now we can calculate the mean +- 3*standard deviation for the range
% for each color

%% % LOG - Started updating at 17.7.18 10:53

% Had a problem that the colour filter kind of destroyed the root. So I
% opened a live script and started tweaking. Turns out the grayness
% checker was too restrictive. So I'm trying out an approach based on the
% original color ranges' size.

% 11:10
% Decided to adjust the previous idea by applying a multiplication to
% adjust to the multiplication of the data itself. Noticed another
% problem: now the root is cut. Will first try to reduce spur.
% It was fixd at the cost of a thorn.
% Will now apply to original code.

% 11:26
% Decided to check to loop I previously used in the broghtness filter.
% The original one is too much. Will try tweaking.
% Found that if I tweak the mult. factor to 1.1 And add a scaled filter
% for a bottom constraint I get better results. Will try some more
% tweaking. Changed the number of runs to 7.
% Will now apply to original code.

% 12:26
% We will now try inverting the image at the beginning as per
% request.
% Also, will now try median filtering before the user chooses points, both for
% his sake and the script's.
% The median filtering was a complete failure. Will try to somehow
% deconvolve/deblur. The good functions require something called PSF but
% there is a blind function that uses a guess for PSF and returns a better
% estimate. So it is possible to then immidiately use a better function.
% I shall test in the live script.



% %18.7.18% %

%10:41
% Had an idea: checking the surroundings of the points and if they are
% bright then choose a smaller crop window. Will try to implement now.

% 13:16
% There are some updates written all over, but that's not why I'm here.
% It would seem the filters are being too restrictive on one of the
% roots. first og all, removed 2 excess medfilts and decided to add a
% condition that if the color ranges are too small so we'll enlarge them.

% 13:36
% Still didn't do the condition but I did tweak the color difference,
% which didn't work well, which made me decide to do the
% *1.1*1.1*(1.1+_^2) even earlier and activate it on the color filters as
% well. and ergo the brightness filter will also be affected.

% 18:13
% Had a genius idea on how to remove thorns EFFECTIVELY
% Doing skel-bwmorph(branchpoints) and then bwareaopen and then fill in
% the gaps. Wiil try

% 18:28
% maybe removing the end points before performing the cleaning will hell.

% 19.7.18

% 1:23
% Will try to use 'adaptthresh' function on the lychcrop2 at the beginning

% 1:47
% After finding that you can change the neighborhood size achieved good
% results. Will try to implement at the beginning.

% 12:39
% Accidently came acrros gamma adjustment, and it might just solve all of
% our problems. will try to implement at the beginning.

% 12:59
% Tweaked some more - sensitivity in imbinarize to 0.95 and spur to 15
% Then tweaked to 1.

% 13:05
% Tweaked so all 3 final bwareaopen (skeletor 1+2 and uniskel) will have
% the number 400. Seems to drastically improve.
% Also removed spur from unskel.
% Tweaked back for skeletor2 to 100.
% And was forced to tweak in uniskel to 70.

% 13:23
% In 4th image, multiplying by 3 from the beginning was problematic. I'll
% try moving it to after the gamma and check.
% Now I'll try to move to after the local thresh.
% Forced to cancel. Let's go over the other images and hope for the best.
% Changed the multiplication in front of the gamma correction to 18 as a
% result. But now I think that I should change it to 10 and then multiply
% the local thresh by 2. will try.

% 13:33
% Decided instead that I will try to implement a condition that if the
% image is too dark multiply by 3.
% After looking at the mean of the 4 pictures, decided on:
% if(mean(mean(mean(lych_tst2)))<0.4)

%14:33
% Changed the statistic of the adpative thresholding to median.
% I think it improved it.

%15:17
% I have decided to try and have the user choose the file.
% I have successfully found a function for that
% uigetfile
% Will implement.

% 15:24
% Needed to change to include path. Also added the '*.jpg'.

% 15:33
% UPDATE - Replaced the content of imread to accomodate the user
% choosing the file.

% 17:40
% Time to implement the feedback of tking an average of the colors of the
% neighborhoods for the points.

% 18:52
% After dawdling, I will move the implementation to main code.

% 19:01
% will try to implement a question for the user whether to clean the photo
% further. Then will try to implement cleaning

% 19:36
% Decided to add a new variable if the user wants cleaning so that he could
% revert one step back if he chooses to. Will also present the choice to
% revert of course.

% 23:26
% I have now found a way to do a "freehand" crop of sorts.
% Will add an optional section that allows the user to freehand crop.

% 20.7.18

% 11:42
% wanted to try to implement a cropping out of offshoots, using the imfreehand
% like yesterday night. But just before I started I had a better idea.
% I will use the freehand crop the user chose for graywarden for BOTH
% graywarden AND brighttst.
