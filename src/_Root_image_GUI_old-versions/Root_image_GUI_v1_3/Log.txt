*----Update log-----Created: 10.8.2018,21:18----*
*************************************************

I have decided to create the beta version.
Now that I started creating the GUI, I have decided to split the process into functions and
use several buttons in the GUI.
I will now start to implement.
For the progress so far see Old_Versions_Log.
I will start by migrating a copy of GUItest and changing it to a beta.

I then went on to separarte the image choosing and image zooming into functions 
and make the appropriate changes to the GUI code.

-21:53
I realized the flag for the zoom is no longer necessary, at least not in the 
same manner, since I shall soon add a zoom button.

-22:02
Migrated the point choosing functionality to an external function and will
now update to the one from lychtst3.

-22:19
I have started migrating the rest of the script.
Started by migrating all of it to a function called root_skel.
Now will delegate all the stuff before the imfreehand to image_process,
the crop to an image_freecrop and the skeleton will stay where it is.
Will create necessary buttons and callbacks.

-23:04
I thought I needed to change something I didn't need to. 
Now I will move the image(cropped_roots_img) to the end of point_choose.

-23:38
Small change - change the prompt of the cleaning.
Big change that will be implemented - migration of cleaning

-- 11.8.18

-01:32
Discovered impoly, which might be easier to handle than imfreehand.
But! I realized that I don't have to choose between them, I can let the user do so.

-01:39
Will try to implement the forcing of the tip now.
Just had an idea - maybe instead of the user clumsily creating a line, we will ask him to 
use impoly to encircle the area between the end of the skeleton and the tip
and whiten it.

-18:17
Several minutes ago started working on implementing a save figure button.
Had to search online for a solution for saving a specific axes.
Will use check boxes to allow the user to save either or both of the axes.

-- 12.8.18

-18:45
Decided to change a little the force tip function.
Instead of 1 we'll try to use root_points_color.

-- 13.8.18

-08:53
Am in the process of implementing the clear image (+left and right checkboxes) and show image.
Show image becomes available after Process image.

-09:25
Decided to scrap force_tip and instead to an open polygon that forces unified skeleton.

-09:30
Moved as a result the enabling of the shower to get skel.

-09:34
Will show skeleton with picture on the right image at shoe skeleton.

-10:10
Decided to change forcetip to imline.

-13:26
Starting to implement the getting the point of most curvature in final_prep.
Will take the point in skelmatR closest to where the user pressed.

-13:35
Decided to migrate "point_get" to a separate file so that final_prep can also use it.
Hopefully it doesn't do problems. And removing the srcx and srcy which are redundant.
and so IMPORTANT: POINT_CHOOSE AND POINT_GET ARE SEPARATE NOW. THE NEW FINAL_PREP 
WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY WITH THE OLD POINT_CHOOSE AND WITHOUT A SEPARATE POINT_GET!

-13:52
I realized the save variables doesn't do what it's suposed to. Will try to fix quickly

-13:59
Will migrate the saving function to a new function.
WARNING: Root_image_GUI_1.3 and further NEED THE NEW FUNCTION!

-14:25
Realized I had to ask the user for a point in final_skeleton for the whole curvature point
to work. So implementation ensued

-14:42
A new decision has been made. We move the cropping in final_prep to after the user's
point selection and we create a new skelmatR_simp which includes the whole root 
and goes with the user's selection if he chooses to choose a point.

-14:59
Had to make more changes to var_saver but now it works! Root_image_GUI_v1.3 
is almost ready! Or if I don't realize why it takes the wrong part of the 
root then it's ready!

-15:16 
I understood the problem!!!
Find uses linear indices, where it goes over the columns instead of the rows. 
So I need to rotate unified skeleton first and then not rotate finalskeleton later!
Hooray!

-15:29
I fixed it! now it is ready! HOORAY!
